        <h5>Architecture :- </h5>
        <img src="a1.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Rajasthan" title="Rajasthan">
        
       <p>The architecture of Rajasthan has usually been a regional variant of the style of Indian architecture prevailing in north India at the time. Rajasthan is especially notable for the forts and palaces of the many Rajput rulers, which are popular tourist attractions.

        Most of the population of Rajasthan is Hindu, and there has historically been a considerable Jain minority; this mixture is reflected in the many temples of the region. Māru-Gurjara architecture, or "Solaṅkī style" is a distinctive style that began in Rajasthan and neighbouring Gujarat around the 11th century, and has been revived and taken to other parts of India and the world by both Hindus and Jains. This represents the main contribution of the region to Hindu temple architecture. The Dilwara Jain Temples of Mount Abu built between the 11th and 13th centuries CE are the best-known examples of the style.
        
        The Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra mosque in Ajmer (no longer in religious use) is an important early example of Indo-Islamic architecture in a state not otherwise notable for this; though the Ajmer Sharif Dargah is another early building. However, there is considerable influence from Mughal architecture in palaces and houses, and Rajasthan has some claim to have sent influence back in elements like the jharokha enclosed balcony and chhatri open pavilions.</p>
       
        <h5>Monumental sculpture :- </h5>
        <img src="a2.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Rajasthan" title="Rajasthan">
        
        <p>Māru-Gurjara architecture, or the "Solaṅkī style" features large amounts of sculpture, with the emphasis usually on great numbers of small, sharply-carved figures, rather than larger single figures or groups. These include friezes with repeated figures of animals, sometimes with human riders, running around the bases of temples.
            The term is also used to describe sculpture that is architectural in function, especially if used to create or form part of a monument of some sort, and therefore capitals and reliefs attached to buildings will be included, even if small in size. Typical functions of monuments are as grave markers, tomb monuments or memorials, and expressions of the power of a ruler or community, to which churches and so religious statues are added by convention, although in some contexts monumental sculpture may specifically mean just funerary sculpture for church monuments.

The third concept that may be involved when the term is used is not specific to sculpture, as the other two essentially are. The entry for "Monumental" in A Dictionary of Art and Artists by Peter and Linda Murray describes it as:[2]

        <h5>Medieval painting :- </h5>
        <img src="a3.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Rajasthan" title="Rajasthan">
       
        <p>Jain temples and monasteries had mural paintings from at least 2,000 years ago, though pre-medieval survivals are rare. In addition, many Jain manuscripts were illustrated with paintings, sometimes lavishly so. In both these cases, Jain art parallels Hindu art, but the Jain examples are more numerous among the earliest survivals. The manuscripts begin around the 11th century, but are mostly from the 13th onwards, and were made mainly in Gujarat, with some in Rajasthan. By the 15th-century they were becoming increasingly lavish, with much use of gold.[3]

            The manuscript text most frequently illustrated is the Kalpa Sūtra, containing the biographies of the Tirthankaras, notably Parshvanatha and Mahavira. The illustrations are square-ish panels set in the text, with "wiry drawing" and "brilliant, even jewel-like colour". The figures are always seen in three-quarters view, with distinctive "long pointed noses and protruding eyes". There is a convention whereby the more distant side of the face protrudes, so that both eyes are seen.[4</p>
    
            <h5>Phad painting :- </h5>
            <img src="a4.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Rajasthan" title="Rajasthan">
            
            <p>Phad paintings are colourful scroll paintings done on cloth, originally made to illustrate the performances of narratives by Bhopa singer/reciters. These have their own styles and patterns and are very popular due to their vibrant colors and historic themes. The Phad of God Devnarayan is largest among the popular Pars in Rajasthan. The painted area of God Devnarayan Ki Phad is 170 square feet (i.e. 34' x 5').[6] Some other Pars are also prevalent in Rajasthan, but being of recent origin they are not classical in composition.[6] Another famous Par painting is Pabuji Ki Phad. Pabuji Ki Phad is painted on a 15 x 5 ft. canvas.[6] Other famous heroes of Phad paintings are Gogaji, Prithviraj Chauhan, Amar Singh Rathore etc</p>
    
            <h5>Jewellery :- </h5>
            <img src="a5.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Rajasthan" title="Rajasthan">
           
            <p>Rajasthani men and women are known to wear exotic pieces of jewellery, specific to the region.</p>
            <p>The typical pieces of gold jewellery that women wear are timaniyan, bala, bajuband, gajra, gokhru, jod, rakhri and so on. Men are also known to wear chokers and earrings. These pieces of jewellery are finely embellished with colourful stones and precious jewels. Ivory (haathidaant) jewellery found in Rajasthan is considered extremely auspicious by several people of the older generations. Earlier only ivory bangles were made by craftsmen. Later, several pieces such as necklaces and earrings started being made from ivory. Given the excessive poaching of elephants for their ivory, stringent laws have now been imposed on ivory trade.</p>
    
            <h5>DANCES of Rajasthan :-</h5>
            <img src="a6.jpg" width="300" height="200" alt="Rajasthan" title="Rajasthan">
            <p>Like all states in India, Rajasthan has its distinctive folk dances. In fact, every region of Rajasthan has its own unique folk dance. Tribal women from the desert region have special dances which are performed on special occasions. Colourful costumes, studded ivory jewellery and intoxicating dance moves are a sight to behold! Some of the most common folk-dance forms of Rajasthan are the Ghoomer, Gair, Chari, Kacchi Ghodi, Kathputli, Bhavai, Drum dance, fire dance, Terah Taali and Maand. Here’s a quick deep dive into each:</p>
            <p>One of the most spectacular dances of the Rajput community, the Ghoomer is essentially a dance performed on special occasions by women folk of the household. Traditionally, this dance is out of bounds for the men of the household, but this trend is slowly wearing off as Ghoomer is requested by several well-read tourists paying a visit to the desert state. In Ghoomer, women twirl around for several hours and this twirling motion is enhanced by the flair of their flowing skirts. Women traditionally wear a veil while performing the Ghoomer. A newly married bride is welcomed into the household with a round of Ghoomer; a tradition that she is requested to participate in.</p>
