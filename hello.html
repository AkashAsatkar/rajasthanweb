       <p>Rajasthan, one of the most coveted travel destinations in India and worldwide, is the land of glistening sandy deserts, multi-coloured fabrics, dulcet folk songs and sprightly dances, ancient traditions and rich handicrafts. Rajasthan encompasses the warm and simplistic lifestyle of the natives and witness to historic battles.</p>
       <p>
A tour of the state will take you through arid yet singularly beautiful desert towns such as Jaisalmer and Barmer to the heart of Rajput grandeur and brilliance such as Udaipur and Chittorgarh. Home to the most fascinating forts, palaces, wildlife sanctuaries, shrines, lakes and the Aravalis, Rajasthan is a true tourist's paradise.</p>
       <p>Also known as the 'land of colours', Rajasthan is situated in the north-western part of India. It is the largest state in India in terms of area. It covers the Thar Desert region and is surrounded by the 'Aravalis', the oldest mountain chain in India. The name Rajasthan literally means 'land of the kings'.

<p>Rajasthan, state of northwestern India, located in the northwestern part of the Indian subcontinent. It is bounded to the north and northeast by the states of Punjab and Haryana, to the east and southeast by the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, to the southwest by the state of Gujarat, and to the west and northwest by the provinces of Sindh and Punjab in Pakistan. The capital city is Jaipur, in the east-central part of the state.</p>
<p>Rajasthan, meaning “The Abode of the Rajas,” was formerly called Rajputana, “The Country of the Rajputs” (sons of rajas [princes]). Before 1947, when India achieved independence from British rule, it comprised some two dozen princely states and chiefships, the small British-administered province of Ajmer-Merwara, and a few pockets of territory outside the main boundaries. After 1947 the princely states and chiefships were integrated into India in stages, and the state took the name Rajasthan. It assumed its present form on November 1, 1956, when the States Reorganization Act came into force. Area 132,139 square miles (342,239 square km). Pop. (2011) 68,621,012.</p>
    <p>But with the government embracing technology as a solution to several systemic problems, now the shortfall in manpower can be addressed by creating a virtual platform through which the government and the public can correspond in real time without the hassle of complex logistics.
And it is with this in  mind that the Rajasthan Government has introduced a platform for people to reach out to the government and express their grievances and even make suggestions. This platform is known as the Rajasthan Sampark Portal. In this article we will be discussing this portal and its various features.</p>
